# MIT-6.009-Spring2022-labs

## What is 6.009
According to [MIT EECS's roadmaps for freshman](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/docs/ug/freshman_roadmaps.pdf), 6.009 Programming is one of the three **foundation subjects**[^1]
for those majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. It is claimed to be a pure programming class, though many common algorithms are used explicitly or implicitly in
lectures and recitations. Since it is classified as a co-requiste with 6.006, background in algorithms is not expected. However, this is not a introductory class in computer
programming.[^2] To get most out of this material, the reader should either have taken an introductory Python course or had experience other languages.

## Access
As of now(2022/3/26), the material is available at [here](https://py.mit.edu/spring22). As this is not published under MIT OCW Project, not all contents on the website is 
accessible to general public. Lectures, for example are not available. Also, it seems that the administrator will shut down access to a semaster's site after the 
semaster ends. To make this educational material useful even after this semaster ends, I downloaded and included those pages I deem necessary to follow through the lab 
sessions. \

Other pages the reader may find useful are listed as follows: in corresponding lab

## My use of this material
To be completed...

[^1]: The other two are 6.004 Computation Structures and the famous 6.006 Algorithms.
[^2]: That will be 6.0001 and 6.0002, available on [ocw.mit.edu](ocw.mit.edu).
