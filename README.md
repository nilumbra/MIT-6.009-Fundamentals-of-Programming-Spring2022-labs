# MIT-6.009-Spring2022-labs

## What is 6.009
According to [MIT EECS's roadmaps for freshman](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/docs/ug/freshman_roadmaps.pdf), 6.009 Programming is one of the three **foundation subjects**[^1]
for those majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. It is claimed to be a pure programming class, though various algorithmic techniques are used throughtout the course both in
lectures and recitations. Since it is classified as a co-requiste with 6.006, background in algorithms is not expected. However, this is not a introductory class in computer
programming.[^2] To get most out of this material, the reader should either have taken an introductory Python course or had experience in other languages.

## Access
As of now(2022/3/26), the material is available at [here](https://py.mit.edu/spring22). Since this is not published under MIT OCW Project, not all contents on the website is 
open to general public. Lectures, for example are not available. Also, it seems that the administrator will shut down access to a semaster's site after the 
semaster ends. To make this educational material useful even after this semaster ends, I downloaded and included those pages I deem necessary to follow through the lab 
sessions. \
